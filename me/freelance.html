            <h3>Game Development</h3>
            <p>I have been playing games and designing my own games since I was a young boy.  
                In college I spent the majority of my non-major credits taking Game Design courses, and was lucky enough to live with other game designers who served to grow the interest.

                As a freelancer I have consulted on a number of games, and I continue to undertake larger roles as the opportunities arise.  
                I work on rulesets regardless of media including boardgames, TTRPGs, and digital games.</p>
